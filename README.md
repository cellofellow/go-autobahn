# GopherJS wrapper for autobahn.js

This project is not an implementation of [Autobahn](http://autobahn.ws/) in
[Go](http://golang.com/), for that see [turnpike](https://github.com/jcelliott/turnpike).

This is a thin wrapper in [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) for
the JavaScript websocket library [Autobahn|JS](http://autobahn.ws/js/). It is
primarily for use in the browser but may work in node.js (I suppose).
